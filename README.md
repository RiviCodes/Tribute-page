# Tribute Page

[Live on GitHub Pages](https://rivicodes.github.io/tribute-page/)

_Basic tribute page made from scratch. This project's objective is to code from zero a tribute page dedicated to an individual, group of them or anyone/anything to give tribute/credit to. My personal pick was Daft Punk since they are one of my favorite duos in my music-taste preference. Page was coded in HTML5 & CSS._
