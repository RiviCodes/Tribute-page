    <h3>Here is a summary of Daft Punk's discography:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1997</strong> - Homework</li>
      <p class="album-review">If there is a valley, or caricature album in Daft’s catalog, it’s Human, the group’s most melodically 
        austere and numbing record. While themes of dark, tech-fearing paranoia were fresh to the group — and 
        employed purposefully, to contrast the buoyancy of Discovery — Human’s themes largely feel recycled; 
        the tech-jargon labyrinth “Technologic,” piggybacks off the more memorable precursor “Harder Better 
        Faster Stronger,” and while plenty catchy in its thick guitar leads, the lead single “Robot Rock” is too 
        on-the-nose for a band famous for its mechanized appearance.</p>
        <p>Typically, Daft is a masterful employer of repetition, but the echoing hooks to “Steam Machine” and 
          “Television” border on monotony, and there just isn’t enough innovation to counteract the dullness. 
          Human is the lone Daft Punk album to feel reactionary to the band’s own success, and even if it did 
          produce a successful inverse to Discovery, it was as impersonal as the group has ever been.</p>
      <li><strong>2001</strong> - Discovery</li>
      <li><strong>2005</strong> - Human After All</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - Random Access Memories</li>
    </ul>
